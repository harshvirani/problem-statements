### Functionalities

> Need to implement application with below functionalities

1. Register and Login Flow
	-  Use firebase and datastore to store newly registered user

2. Once user is logged in there should be a dashboard screen Which should show List of all users (This should be real-time if i update some details from profile page it should auto-reflect without any reload)
	- On click of any user it should show user's detail view
	- If user rotates phone to potrait mode than it should show list and detail view both side-by-side(For and example if i am on detail view of user and rotate the phone than it should show list on left side and on right side it should show detail view of the user)
	- in potrait mode it should hilight the user which is visible on right side

3. Profile update screen
	- User should be able to update the profile details

4. Logout


### Deliverable
1. All code should be pushed to private repository of the github and give access to `@harshvirani` user so we can review it

3. Need to share `.apk` file of the final deliverable
